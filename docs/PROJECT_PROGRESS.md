## Verified progress

### PR #4 merged

- PR: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/4
- Title: `test: orchestration fault matrix`
- Source head: `817d4e6342ac975efa61a73ac6c10f36fcd0f68d`
- CI run: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40696961658
- CI conclusion: success for the exact PR head SHA. The offline job completed compilation, offline contract tests, redacted acceptance report generation, artifact upload, and final gate.
- Merge commit on `feat/semantic-review-core-20261028`: `75b0892c4976e7e060a7f43f68c150777458e7b5`

### Supply-chain pinning proposal

- Branch: `fix/pin-github-actions-sha-20261028`
- Pinned `actions/checkout` v5 to `fbc6f3992d24b796d5a048ff273f7fcc4a7b6c09`.
- Pinned `actions/setup-python` v6 to `ece7cb06caefa5fff74198d8649806c4678c61a1`.
- Pinned `actions/upload-artifact` v4 to `ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02`.
- The SHA values were read from the corresponding official `actions/*` GitHub tag refs during this work round. These are pinned to the resolved commits, with readable tag comments retained.
- Workflow permissions remain explicitly limited to `contents: read`.
- PR #5 was merged into the integration branch after CI and diff verification.

### Gate and test coverage

The final gate requires the test, report-build, and artifact-upload stages to report exact `success`. Hosted evidence covers the normal artifact-upload path and fail-closed behavior when artifact input is missing or the consumer test command fails. No real GitHub Artifact service outage has been simulated.

## Limits of current evidence

- PR #5 CI passed on the exact PR head before merge; both push and pull-request runs succeeded.
- Hosted failure-path tests have been performed for missing artifact input and consumer test-command failure. They do not establish behavior during an actual Artifact service outage.
- No real model validation or second independent consumer integration pilot has been completed.
- The local working tree/synchronization state has not been verified.
- No changes were made to `main`.

## Next steps

1. Review the successful Node.js consumer pilot evidence and decide whether to revise the consumer PR; keep it draft until separately reviewed.
2. Review the completed independent consumer pilot evidence; keep the consumer PR draft/unmerged until separately authorized.
3. Begin controlled real-model validation with strict quotas and no production actions, then define 0.x release criteria from the accumulated evidence.
3. Define objective 0.x release criteria after the independent pilot evidence is available.
4. Conduct controlled real-model validation after offline and hosted reliability boundaries are documented.
5. Keep the Artifact-service-outage boundary explicitly unverified; do not let this hard-to-reproduce scenario block a low-risk independent consumer pilot.

## Decision record

- PR #4 was merged only into `feat/semantic-review-core-20261028` after explicit user authorization.
- PR #5 supply-chain pinning was merged into the integration branch after explicit user direction and successful CI.
- Do not merge to `main`, create a release, or integrate into a consumer project without separate review and authorization.

### PR #5 merged: supply-chain pinning

- PR: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/5
- Merge commit on `feat/semantic-review-core-20261028`: `50c8027dd6e410f7d40d21778e74a8c5b22fe364`
- PR head: `5af3377d0533229d98eb7ccaa86830fbb4d48af3`
- Both automatic CI runs passed; no manual workflow dispatch was used.
- Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs; workflow permissions remain `contents: read`.

### Hosted fault-path validation: missing artifact input

- Temporary PR: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/6 (closed, not merged).
- Test commit: `1add4e2369f6e1daa343e36b442bd10b51dae63c`.
- Run: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40712433963
- Result: 89 offline tests passed; report generation passed; upload step failed as deliberately configured because the requested artifact path did not exist; final gate failed with `ARTIFACT_OUTCOME=failure` and named `artifact` as the unsuccessful required stage.
- This proves the hosted workflow closes the gate on an upload-step failure. It does **not** simulate a GitHub artifact-service outage or validate service-level behavior.
- The test-only PR was closed after evidence collection and was never merged. Its workflow was restored to the normal artifact path in cleanup commit `9254c3058196a192227bb56a1d6c634ecefbc72d`. The temporary branch remains for auditability; no changes were made to `main`.

### Consumer pilot preparation and normal-path verification

- Draft PR #7: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/7
- Branch: `test/consumer-pilot-readiness-20261028`; tested head: `bff949fba82e5c514ed9f0f11a32120dae2faabf`.
- Added `docs/CONSUMER_PILOT_CHECKLIST.md` with entry criteria, controlled pilot steps, pass/fail criteria, evidence capture, and stop conditions. The file was read back from GitHub; blob SHA: `afdc2781809e8e1d1e332c739bdbee4d63989a22`.
- The checklist explicitly distinguishes a missing-artifact-input failure from a real GitHub Artifact service outage.
- Hosted CI run [40713631149](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40713631149), run number 100, completed successfully for the exact PR head `bff949fba82e5c514ed9f0f11a32120dae2faabf`. Offline tests, report generation, artifact upload, and final gate all succeeded; artifact ID `12826902344`.
- PR #7 was closed unmerged after its checklist content was carried into PR #8; no consumer repository has been merged or released, and no changes were made to `main`.

### Reusable acceptance workflow report and fail-closed gate

- Draft PR #8: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/8
- Branch: `feat/reusable-acceptance-report-gate-20261028`; tested PR head: `58dc2c5a84099e588797beccc1ad3b9802614108`.
- Added a redacted consumer acceptance report containing only schema version, consumer commit SHA, caller workflow reference/SHA, test status, and overall status. The workflow attempts report generation and upload after test failure, then opens the gate only if test, report, and artifact stages all have exact `success`.
- Added `tests/test_reusable_workflow_contract.py` to check read-only permissions, immutable action pins, report allowlist, failure continuation, and final-gate rules.
- Updated reusable-workflow documentation, pilot checklist, and roadmap to reflect the implementation and its limits.
- Hosted CI run [40714595099](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40714595099), run number 108, completed successfully for PR #8's exact tested head `58dc2c5a84099e588797beccc1ad3b9802614108`. The run log confirms 93 offline tests passed, report generation passed, artifact ID `12827468404` was uploaded, and the final gate passed.
- This validates the Harness repository CI and workflow-contract tests, not by itself the called workflow's behavior in a consumer context.
- PR #8 is draft and unmerged. No changes were made to `main`.

### Reusable workflow consumer normal-path smoke test

- Draft PR #9: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/9
- Branch: `test/reusable-workflow-smoke-20261028`; tested head: `71ec801a1c84c2a52920386466d3c9b63075f0fa`.
- Added `.github/workflows/reusable-acceptance-smoke.yml`, invoking the reusable workflow at immutable SHA `58dc2c5a84099e588797beccc1ad3b9802614108`.
- Consumer workflow run [40714715392](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40714715392) completed successfully. The called job's checkout, Python setup, consumer test command, redacted report generation, artifact upload, and final gate all succeeded.
- Artifact `consumer-acceptance-report` ID: `12827428586`; digest: `sha256:b9b896241e5840897a9c65595cf0008bab79a5e2ea9d6287fe624ba1dd8b40cf`.
- The same PR's Harness CI run [40714714617](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40714714617) also succeeded.
- This is a same-repository smoke test only, not proof of a second independent consumer. PR #9 was closed unmerged after its successful run and artifact evidence were recorded.

### Reusable workflow consumer failure-path smoke test

- Temporary draft PR #10: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/10 (closed, not merged).
- Branch: `test/reusable-workflow-failure-smoke-20261028`; tested head: `dc46f7593f95fd1e84e0438d2b5c2bdf661910a2`.
- Run [40714856655](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40714856655) completed with the expected failure. The consumer test command exited 23; the report step still succeeded and recorded `status: failed`; the artifact uploaded successfully (artifact ID `12827258524`); the final gate exited 1 and reported only the unsuccessful required stage `tests`.
- The run log verified `TEST_OUTCOME=failure`, `REPORT_OUTCOME=success`, and `ARTIFACT_OUTCOME=success`. This demonstrates that a consumer test failure cannot be hidden by a successful report upload.
- The temporary PR was closed after evidence collection and was never merged. No changes were made to `main`.


### Multi-runtime reusable workflow implementation

- Extended the reusable acceptance workflow to support explicit `python` and `node` runtimes; unsupported runtime values fail closed.
- Node setup action pin verified against the official `actions/setup-node` repository: commit `48b55a011bda9f5d6aeb4c2d9c7362e8dae4041e`, release v6.4.0.
- Added contract tests for the runtime allowlist, conditional setup steps, immutable Node action pin, and disabled package-manager cache.
- Workflow-code candidate SHA: `65544e290fd875bb6c4e30f6525b238200037bba`.
- Hosted Harness CI run [40715196026](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40715196026), run number 126, completed successfully for that exact code SHA; the 93-test suite, report, artifact upload, and final gate succeeded. Artifact ID: `12827137999`.
- Latest PR #8 head after documentation evidence updates: `7e58aaf1d73d82319808a22bf26004e062b67b19`; hosted CI run [40715766990](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40715766990), run number 136, also completed successfully.
- The Node runtime was subsequently verified by the independent consumer pilot below.

### Independent Node.js consumer pilot

- Draft consumer PR: https://github.com/wosafety0/AI-Worker-Proxy/pull/1
- Branch: `test/dev-workflow-kit-pilot-20261028`; tested head: `642c627bdb8f2e3c791835ec78f837a258c3eb97`.
- Added `.github/workflows/dev-workflow-kit-pilot.yml`, pinned to Harness SHA `65544e290fd875bb6c4e30f6525b238200037bba`, using Node.js 26 and the consumer's existing `pnpm check` after a frozen-lockfile install.
- Consumer workflow run [40715309593](https://github.com/wosafety0/AI-Worker-Proxy/actions/runs/40715309593) completed successfully for exact head `642c627bdb8f2e3c791835ec78f837a258c3eb97`. Node.js 26 setup succeeded; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` installed 236 packages; `pnpm check` passed (`tsc --noEmit && eslint src`); redacted report generation, artifact upload, and final gate succeeded.
- Consumer artifact `consumer-acceptance-report` ID: `12828925328`; digest: `sha256:ab0642ac0f7590352cabc08d504b21c75a3b8612e14b6be72ac6fd33f23c938d`.
- The consumer's existing `Lint and Type Check` run [40715308397](https://github.com/wosafety0/AI-Worker-Proxy/actions/runs/40715308397) also completed successfully.
- This verifies cross-repository Node runtime consumption on the exact tested Harness SHA. The PR is draft and unmerged; it adds only a read-only acceptance workflow and does not deploy the Cloudflare Worker or modify `main`.


### Updated multi-runtime Node failure-path validation

- Temporary draft PR #11: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/11 (closed, not merged).
- Tested head: `e353f34d314aff450801a1108e00dd2a409166f2`; reusable workflow pinned to candidate SHA `65544e290fd875bb6c4e30f6525b238200037bba`.
- Run [40715636382](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40715636382) completed with the expected failure after Node.js 26 setup succeeded.
- The consumer command exited 23; the report recorded `status: failed`; artifact upload succeeded (artifact ID `12828236019`); the final gate exited 1 and named `tests` as the failed required stage.
- Run logs verified `TEST_OUTCOME=failure`, `REPORT_OUTCOME=success`, and `ARTIFACT_OUTCOME=success`. The temporary PR was closed after evidence capture and was never merged.


### Local inference endpoint transport hardening

- Draft PR #12: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/12
- Branch: `fix/local-loopback-model-endpoint-20261028`; tested head: `0b86ce1066e84c6056ec3eb5daa5329ce746c99a`.
- Changed `validate_model_config` to allow HTTPS for remote providers and HTTP only for literal loopback IPs (IPv4/IPv6). Hostname-based `localhost`, non-loopback HTTP, embedded URL credentials, query strings, fragments, malformed ports, and control characters remain rejected.
- Added offline tests for `http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1` and `http://[::1]:1235/v1`, and retained negative tests for unsafe HTTP endpoints. Updated `docs/STABLE_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md`.
- Hosted CI run [40716125120](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40716125120), run number 144, succeeded on the exact tested head. 90 offline tests passed, the acceptance report uploaded (artifact ID `12829135525`), and the final gate passed.
- This validates configuration parsing and security boundaries only. It does not constitute a live model request or prove that the user's local LM Studio endpoint is reachable from this environment. PR #12 remains draft and unmerged.

### Semantic-review redirect credential-leak fix (2026-10-29)

- During a local, isolated two-server reproduction, Python's default `urllib` behavior followed a model-endpoint HTTP 302 and forwarded the original `Authorization: Bearer ...` header to the redirect destination. The reproduction used only a disposable test token and local loopback listeners; no provider or user credential was involved.
- Added `_NoRedirectHandler` to reject redirects for both HTTPS provider requests and literal-loopback HTTP requests. Loopback requests still use a request-scoped empty `ProxyHandler`; no global proxy settings are changed.
- Updated `docs/STABLE_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md` to make redirect rejection an explicit fail-closed requirement; contract update commit: `50f814fce8cef6e9b3d9e10294255c06d5de44c3`.
- Added an offline loopback regression test that returns a redirect to a second local listener and asserts the destination receives no request. Updated transport mocks to use the explicit opener.
- PR #22: https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/pull/22, Draft and unmerged. Tested source head before this archive update: `1443f15c578e4ea0862458d94aebdf77427701cd`.
- Exact-head push CI [run 40803605132](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40803605132) and PR-context CI [run 40803630242](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40803630242) both completed successfully. The PR-context job passed Python compilation, the offline contract suite, report generation, artifact upload, and the final gate.
- Verification boundary: this proves the redirect rejection behavior with local offline tests and the repo's CI. No real model provider request was made; no PR was merged and no release or deployment occurred.
- Follow-up exact-head verification: commit `9586439a74cc8c7a25dbdac89308111ff7f32865` passed push CI [40803733451](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40803733451) and PR-context CI [40803740841](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40803740841); both succeeded with **106 offline tests passed**, report generation, artifact upload, and final gate. These runs include the updated contract and the progress archive as committed on that head.


## 2026-10-29 — enable PR-context CI for stacked fix PRs (PR #22 base)

- PR #33 is stacked on PR #22's `fix/semantic-review-no-redirect-20261029` branch. Inspection of the actual base commit workflow showed `pull_request.branches` included `main`, `feat/**`, and `test/**`, but not `fix/**`. Changing only the downstream PR head cannot make GitHub evaluate a new filter from the base branch.
- Updated this branch's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include `fix/**`, so downstream PR #33 can receive PR-context CI. This follows the same trigger correction needed for other stacked fix branches.
- Workflow commit: `f6bb3db6cf1c93a18a98bd844cd253a043fae38a`.
- Validation boundary: the downstream PR-context run must be independently observed after the base-branch workflow update. PR #22 remains Draft/unmerged; no rebase, retarget, merge, or consumer pin update occurred.


## 2026-10-29 — PR-context CI validates stacked-fix trigger correction

- PR #22 head `46587adaf9160c4e0b8503dfe49dc779cd976a33` received a successful PR-context Harness CI run: [run 40859961406](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40859961406).
- The run tested merge commit `e41cc9887e65ebd8f110761853261e0cadd02cf6`, ran **106 offline tests**, generated/uploaded acceptance-report artifact `12891346305`, and passed the final orchestration gate.
- This verifies the CI workflow correction against PR #22's current merge context. It does not validate PR #33's duplicate-key implementation; PR #33 still needs its own exact-head PR-context CI run.


## 2026-10-30 — Candidate reconstruction on current base (PR #33)

- Created isolated candidate branch `reconcile/pr-33-on-current-base-20261030` from current recorded base SHA `071c168bc9532ba8d8c6a9f4708046e164879568`; original PR and rescue refs remain unchanged.
- Applied the bounded-response and duplicate-JSON implementation/tests, Windows-resolved runner path assertions, and merged the stable-contract statements into the current base contract rather than replacing that contract wholesale.
- Candidate head and exact-head validation remain to be verified. This is a reconstruction candidate, not a validated replacement for PR #33. No tests were run by the connector in this step.


## 2026-10-30 — trigger exact-head Push CI for PR #33 reconstruction candidate

- Candidate branch `fix/reconcile-pr-33-current-base-20261030` is a copy of the isolated reconstruction `reconcile/pr-33-on-current-base-20261030`; the original PR and rescue refs remain untouched.
- This archive commit is intended to trigger the repository's Push CI for the candidate head. Results must be queried by exact commit SHA before the candidate is considered validated.
- Candidate remains non-mergeable until CI and patch review are complete. No original PR retarget or merge was performed.

## 2026-10-30 — Duplicate-input JSON regression repaired on reconstruction candidate

- Exact-head Push CI initially failed on candidate commit `06858e97bd0a3657c2a379f97807003876b15202` (run [40912095333](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40912095333)). The failing test was `test_duplicate_input_json_keys_fail_closed_before_model_call`: the duplicate-key hook raised plain `ValueError`, while the CLI's fail-closed handler catches `ReviewError`.
- Corrected `scripts/ai_semantic_review.py` so duplicate JSON keys raise `ReviewError`, preserving rejection while allowing the CLI to return its documented blocked exit code and remove any stale PASS artifact.
- Fix commit: `d5346d0571ce6933c643220791ec020d8b26cf2a` on `fix/reconcile-pr-33-current-base-20261030`. Exact-head Push CI [40928437863](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40928437863) completed successfully: Python compilation passed, **108 offline tests passed**, redacted acceptance report upload succeeded, and the final acceptance gate passed.
- Verification scope is the candidate branch's Push CI only. No live provider request or credential was used. Original PR #33 and PR #22 were not retargeted, merged, or closed; the reconstruction candidate remains separate pending patch review and PR-context CI. No release or deployment occurred.
- Draft PR #34 is open against base branch fix/semantic-review-no-redirect-20261029 at base SHA 071c168bc9532ba8d8c6a9f4708046e164879568. Initial candidate head 465dd824b5234a34f390aa80b3cacfcb08a45fd3 passed exact-head Push CI [40928555354](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40928555354) and PR-context CI [40928587632](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40928587632). The subsequent progress-archive head 101a8d97593d6d66eb96212aea7cd1339e016521 passed Push CI [40929452332](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40929452332). The current candidate head b2fc14881ea299448b5c1f8cbbd8ecc079e65117 also passed exact-head Push CI [40929747847](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40929747847) and PR-context CI [40929756561](https://github.com/wosafety0/dev-workflow-kit/actions/runs/40929756561): 108 offline tests, report upload, and final gate succeeded. PR #34 remains Draft/open; original PR #33 remains open/Draft and was not modified. No PR was merged, and no release/deployment occurred.
- Next: review the full candidate diff and confirm stacked dependency. Do not merge automatically; preserve PR #33 and its rescue refs until the candidate is reviewed.
